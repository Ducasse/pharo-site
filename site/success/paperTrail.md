Sea Ranger Service - World's first maritime ranger service!

For the Sea Rangers, we created a platform named Paper Trail in which every team member has a clear overview of all the 
agendas of meetings they attend. Every meeting follows their personalised accountability format. Agenda points are easily recorded centrally by 
each team and after a meeting has been concluded, each member receives her action points. This creates a trail of meetings with agenda and 
action items for each team over time, hence the name Paper Trail.
